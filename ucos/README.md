=========================

PORTING OF MICRO-C/OS II FOR ARM CORTEX-M4F BASED MICROCONTROLLER


Primary objective of this project is to port Micro-C/OS II version 2.92 on ARM Cortex-M4 based microcontroller. BSP is developed for push button, PIR sensor, UART and RGB LED. PIR sensor detects movement within its field of view. LED blink indicates the movement. Serial console prints status of tasks and communicated via UART. These tasks are scheduled by
Micro-C/OS II kernel. The Micro-C/OS II schedules tasks based on taskâ€Ÿs priority. An application is designed for the scenario. Micro-C/OS II is ported on Tiva C Series TM4C123G microcontroller.
